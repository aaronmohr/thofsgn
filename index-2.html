        <p>“Like all of Jon Lawless's stuff under the Swim Good Now moniker, Dark Desires is expertly produced.</p> 
        <p>I especially love how the serene layers on this track smoothly intertwine, but are punctuated by sudden atonal bursts, just to keep you guessing.”</p>

        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <img src="img/sgnxthof.jpg">
        <p>swim good now &amp; The Techno Hall of Fame is a collaborative project a long time in the making. The project began in 2018 with no direction in mind, continuing a 10 year tradition of off-and-on collaboration between the two friends.</p> 
        <p>One was experiencing a sea change in Toronto’s west end and channeling it into his song-writing. The other was settling into life as a producer in small town Ontario and expecting his first child. Both had recently turned the corner into their thirties and dealing with a tension that began to express itself in intimate, cinematic songs about uncertainty and love.</p>
        <p>swim good now released his debut album in 2018 with Toronto’s Secret Songs collective. In the past he has worked and toured with members of Bon Iver, Stars, and the Avalanches.</p>
        <p>The Techno Hall of Fame has been involved in Toronto’s DIY music scene through a collective he founded in 2014 (Bedroomer) and making his living as a graphic designer.</p>
        <p>Additional collaborations on Part I include Daniela Andrade, Rosy Glow, Ryan Hemsworth, and Teen Daze.</p>
